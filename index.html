    <h2>Chaining vs. Chainless</h2>
    <p>Before reading the explanation individual commands it is important to understand the difference between chained and chainless d3 commands.</p> <p>Chained commands use a dot and then the command name to connect to other commands. In this format, order matters.</p>
    <p>Chainless commands use variables to assign commands to. Once those variables have been made they can bee strung together like normal javascript. In this format order only matters when combining variables, but not when defining them.</p>
